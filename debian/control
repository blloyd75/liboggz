Description: convenience interface for Ogg stream I/O
 Oggz provides a simple programming interface for reading and writing
 Ogg files and streams.
 .
 liboggz supports the flexibility afforded by the Ogg file format while
 presenting the following API niceties:
 .
  * Strict adherence to the formatting requirements of Ogg bitstreams,
    to ensure that only valid bitstreams are generated.
  * A simple, callback based open/read/close or open/write/close interface
    to raw Ogg files.
  * A customisable seeking abstraction for seeking on multitrack Ogg data.
  * A packet queue for feeding incoming packets for writing, with callback
    based notification when this queue is empty.
  * A handy table structure for storing information on each logical
    bitstream.
